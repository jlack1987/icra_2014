\section{Partial Hybrid Zero Dynamics}
For the continuous dynamics of multi-domain hybrid systems, the goal of the control law in EQREF is to drive the dynamics of the system to the 
\textit{zero dynamics manifold}:
\begin{align}
 \nonumber
\ZeroDynamics_{\indexbyvertex{\param}} = \{(\q,\dq) \in \ConfigurationSpace :  \hspace{1mm} &\yone(\q,\dq) = 0, \\&
\ytwo(\q) = \mathbf{0}, \ydottwo(\q,\dq) = \mathbf{0}\}
\label{eq:ZD}
\end{align}
where $\yone(\q,\dq)$ and $\ytwo(\q,\dq)$ are a set of relative degree one and two outputs. The following is a Partial Zero Dynamics Surface
\begin{align}
\label{PZD}
\PartialZeroDynamics_{\indexbyvertex{\param}} = \{(\q,\dq) \in \ConfigurationSpace : \ytwo(\q) = \mathbf{0}, \ydottwo(\q,\dq) = \mathbf{0}\}
\end{align}
A partial hybrid zero dynamics on a graph is
\begin{align}
\label{PZD}

\end{align}


What is a partial hybrid zero dynamics surface in this case?

\newsec{Motion Transitions.} Why do we want motion transitions? What is the definition of a motion transition? --> What equations must be satisfied, does it depend on alpha and theta or just theta? What are two examples of motion transitions? I.e. transition for domain 2 and domain 3. Thanks.
