\section{Simulation Results}
The results discussed here are the result of a single optimization run with the robot parameters being that of
Amber 2.0, a robot designed and built in AMBER Lab. The mass and length parameters are shown in Table \ref{table:params} where
the mass and length notation is as defined in Fig. \ref{fig:robotparams}.

Tiles showing multiple frames of the robot as it moves through three steps are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:tiles}.

Fig. \ref{fig:Outputs} shows the actual and desired outputs over one step for I/O Linearization alone(Top Left and Top Right) as well as
Control Lyapunov Functions(Bottom Left and Bottom Right). The figure shows how both methods yield almost exactly the same result.
The main difference lies in the walking speed. Using Control Lyapunov Functions, the hip velocity does not quite
converge back to the desired value; however, this simply results in a slightly slower walking speed.

\caption{Torque profiles for 1-step using I/O Linearization(Left) and Control Lyapunov Functions(Right). Note that for the double support phase in the
 figure on the right, a torque bound of 10Nm was enforced. This is evident by the way the torque flat lines at 10Nm.}
\label{fig:Torque}
\end{figure}
Fig. \ref{fig:Torque} shows the joint torques for both I/O Linearization(Left) and CLF(Right). The joint torques for I/O Linearization alone
are \emph{extremely high}, especially for the double support phase in which one would
suspect the torques to be minimal based on the fact that both feet are on the ground and the robot is in a stable configuration.
The torques for the two single support domains are high as well considering the motors in AMBER2 can output approximately 30-40
Nm, making the ~150 Nm torques required 5 times the amount the robot can actually supply. Possibly an even worse result from I/O Linearization
 alone is the fact that for an n-DOF configuration, only n-torques can be specified regardless of the number of actuators
on the robot. This makes experimental implementation of torque control via simple I/O Linearization impossible for overactuated phases of bipedal walking.
The plot of the torques over one step for the \emph{same walking gait} using the quadratic program are shown
in Fig. \ref{fig:Torque} on the right.

\end{figure}
With a maximum torque of ~150 Nm with I/O Linearization and ~15 Nm with CLF/QP, the improvement in controller
performance becomes abundantly clear. In addition to torque reduction, we are able to specify torques for
all 6 actuators.
